    "We'll go step by step:\n",
    "1. First define your two different lookback periods: a short window(30) and a long window(120). Assign these integers to 2 variables. Make sure that the integer that you assign to the short window is shorter than the integer that you assign to the long window variable!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, make an empty signals DataFrame, but do make sure to copy the index of your msft data so that you can start calculating the daily buy or sell signal for your msft data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a column in your empty signals DataFrame that is named signal and initialize it by setting the value for all rows in this column to 0.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now that preparatory work is done, it’s time to create the set of short and long simple moving averages over the respective long and short time windows. Make use of the `rolling()` function to start your rolling window calculcations: within the function, specify the window and the min_period, and set the center argument. In practice, this will result in a `rolling()` function to which you have passed either short_window or long_window, 1 as the minimum number of observations in the window that are required to have a value, and `False`, so that the labels are not set at the center of the window. Next, don’t forget to also chain the `mean()` function so that you calculate the rolling mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once you have calculated the mean average of the short and long windows, you should create a signal when the short moving average crosses the long moving average, but only for the period greater than the shortest moving average window. In Python, this will result in a condition: **signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:]**. Note that you add the [short_window:] to comply with the condition “only for the period greater than the shortest moving average window”. When the condition is true, the initialized value 0.0 in the signal column will be overwitten with 1.0. A “signal” is created! If the condition is false, the original value of 0.0 will be kept and no signal is generated. You use the NumPy where() function to set up this condition. Much the same like you read just now, the variable to which you assign this result is `signals['signal'][short_window]`, because you only want to create signals for the period greater than the shortest moving average window!\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Lastly, you take the difference of the signals in order to generate actual trading orders. In other words, in this column of your signals DataFrame, you’ll be able to distinguish between long and short positions, whether you’re buying or selling stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dual moving average crossover occurs when a short-term average crosses a long-term average. \n",
    "This signal is used to identify that momentum is shifting in the direction of the short-term average. A buy signal is generated when the short-term average crosses the long-term average and rises above it, while a sell signal is triggered by a short-term average crossing long-term average and falling below it.\n",
